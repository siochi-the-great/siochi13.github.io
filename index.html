            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I'm <b>Franz Josef Siochi</b> I was born in Malabon City, a coastal city in Metro Manila.<sup><b>1</b></sup> My childhood days were one of the best moments of my life.<sup><b>2</b></sup> These were the times when my friends would invite me to play outside—games like tagu-taguan and patintero.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I also played role-playing games like bahay-bahayan with my cousins at home.<sup><b>4</b></sup> We would listen to and sing along to jejemon songs together.<sup><b>5</b></sup> After that, we would just watch TV and enjoy our time.<sup><b>6</b></sup>
                This was also the time I was introduced to computers.<sup><b>7</b></sup> I remember seeing my first computer, and my dad was using it.<sup><b>8</b></sup> It was fascinating to watch.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Around this time, I was also introduced to video games.<sup><b>10</b></sup> I would watch my dad play, observing everything before trying it myself.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Pero nakalaro din ako ng laro sa computer.<sup><b>12</b></sup> My first game was <i>Command & Conquer: Generals</i>, which is still my favorite game.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Nagustuhan ko kasi yung gameplay at yung uniqueness ng game, and that's why nagka-interest din ako sa history—especially war history.<sup><b>14</b></sup>
                Pero noong time na yun, nasira yung computer namin, at nakita ko yung components, which I found very, very interesting—even until today.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Pero for the meantime, sa comshop kami nagko-computer.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Mura pa noon ang price rate ng comshop, 10 pesos per hour.<sup><b>17</b></sup> Tapos doon ko rin nalaro yung second favorite game ko, which is <i>GTA: San Andreas</i>.<sup><b>18</b></sup> The open-world experience of the game was so immersive and enjoyable.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> I spent hours exploring, completing missions, and trying different things in the game.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></p>

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        </div>

        <div align="justify">
            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my teenage years, when I was in Grade 6, I had this one friend—the only friend I had because I wasn’t really a social person.<sup><b>1</b></sup> Lagi siyang nambuburaot sakin ng 5 pesos, but in exchange, he protected me since I was often bullied during that time.<sup><b>2</b></sup> Grade 6 was definitely not my favorite time in life.<sup><b>3</b></sup> Teachers still used slippers and long flat wood to punish students who were sleeping or interrupting their lectures.<sup><b>4</b></sup> I remember seeing my classmates get punished, which I found sad.<sup><b>5</b></sup> However, there was one moment in Grade 6 that I did like—graduation.<sup><b>6</b></sup> It marked the end of that chapter and the start of high school life.<sup><b>7</b></sup>
                In high school, I joined a marching music band.<sup><b>8</b></sup> This was when I discovered my talent for playing the saxophone.<sup><b>9</b></sup> My dad is a musician, so I basically inherited my talent from him.<sup><b>10</b></sup> He wanted me to become a musician because some universities offer scholarships to talented individuals.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Because of this, I enrolled at UE, following in my dad's footsteps, before later transferring to UST.<sup><b>12</b></sup> During those years, I developed my musical skills while also gaining educational knowledge.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Over time, I became more focused on learning—some might even say I became a nerd, which was fine with me.<sup><b>14</b></sup>
                High school was a mix of challenges and great experiences.<sup><b>15</b></sup> One of the highlights was performing at school events, which became some of my favorite moments from my teenage years.<sup><b>16</b></sup> When I reached Grade 12, I auditioned for both Adamson and UE.<sup><b>17</b></sup> At that time, I felt nervous, fearing I might not get accepted.<sup><b>18</b></sup> But in the end, I passed both auditions.<sup><b>19</b></sup> However, I chose UE because it was just one ride away, I knew many people there, and I was familiar with the head of the UE band.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></p>

            <h2>Collage Years</h2>
        </div>

        <div align="justify">
            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my college years, bago pa man ang first day ng pasok, may GC na yung very first block section ko.<sup><b>1</b></sup> Nagplano sila ng meet-up, and for me, this was both exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time.<sup><b>2</b></sup> Hindi ko alam paano makipagkaibigan kasi hindi naman ako marunong makipag-socialize.<sup><b>3</b></sup> Pero okay lang, kasi nung nakita ko sila, dun ko naramdaman na parang kaya ko naman makipag-socialize.<sup><b>4</b></sup> Mas gusto ko pa rin yung ka-humor ko, at buti na lang meron naman.<sup><b>5</b></sup>
                Nung first day of school, nag-usap-usap na kami, and after that, lumabas kami para kumain nang sabay-sabay.<sup><b>6</b></sup> Ito yung moment sa buhay ko na nagkaroon ako ng madaming friends.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Hindi ko in-expect na may ka-humor pala ako.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Simula noon, mas naging madali sakin ang makipag-usap sa iba.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Araw-araw kaming nagtatawanan at nagkukwentuhan.<sup><b>10</b></sup>
                Sa experience ko, college is a challenging time.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Minsan malulungkot ka kasi hindi ka pumasa sa quiz.<sup><b>12</b></sup> Maraming academic activities na mahirap ipasa.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Pero masaya rin kasi yung mga kaibigan mo ang nagpapasaya sayo.<sup><b>14</b></sup> Walang ending na tawanan at kwentuhan.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Tapos magkakaroon ka pa ng bagong crush, na minsan nagiging motivation mo sa pagpasok.<sup><b>16</b></sup>
                Para sa akin, ito ang best time ng buhay ko.<sup><b>17</b></sup> Kahit mahirap at puno ng challenges, worth it pa rin.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Dito ko nakita na hindi ka kailanman magiging mag-isa.<sup><b>19</b></sup> Ang college ay hindi lang tungkol sa pag-aaral kundi sa pagbuo ng tunay na pagkakaibigan.<sup><b>20</b></sup> Natutunan ko rin kung paano maging independent at mas confident sa sarili.<sup><b>21</b></sup></blockquote></p>
